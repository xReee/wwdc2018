//: # Welcome to Accessibility for iOS Developers!
//: ### My name is **Renata**, I'm a 21 years old undergraduate student. For more information about me check the end of this project.
//: ### Last year I've made some research about accessibility and I realized that developers do not worry with this as much as they should (even Apple having accessibility tools which are easy to use).
//: #
//: #
//: ### Well... if it is easy to use, why did I create a playground for it?
//: ### First: I expect people who watch my video, available on YouTube, will try this code and open their eyes for those tools and motivate them to use it.
//: ### Second: I want to share my knowledge, so other developers won't pass by first steps difficulties.
