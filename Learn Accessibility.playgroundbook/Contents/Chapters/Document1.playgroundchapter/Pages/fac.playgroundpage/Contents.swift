 ## Why should I develop accessible apps?
 - Because you will open your app for a new client segment. Did you know the U.S. Census Bureau states that, in 2010, 18% of north american population have some kind of disabilities and a census made by Wireless RERC, in 2016, states that 84% of this population own or use a cellphone or smartphone?
 - This is so important that it is a Apple's value!
 - Because it's a law! In the U.S., if you're doing an app for the government, you're required to implement **508 compilance**, making your app accessible to all users.
 - And it's as easy as writing a text in a label or text field.
