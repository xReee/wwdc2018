 ## Using Gestures to navigation

 Maybe you are asking "how can a person with low vision could see where are the objects?". Don't worry, Apple though about that and implemented "navigation with gestures". Try to **swipe anywhere in the screen, to the right to go to the next view and to the left to go back to the previously one**, to navigate between all views.
 
 Also, there are actionable objects and to make them work just **select them and tap twice anywhere**, try it using this button "travel". Please, remember this is just a playgrounds, that means you have a lot of different gestures not implemented yet.
 
 Now, I think you are prepared to try the truly VoiceOver with your app. To turn it on follow:
 
 ### General -> Accessibility -> VoiceOver
 
[please click here to go to the next page.](@next)
